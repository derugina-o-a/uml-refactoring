<h2 class="header">About the UML Refactoring project</h2>

<p>The main goal of the UML Refactoring project is to develop mathematical methods and software products of the UML class diagram refactoring.</p>

<p>As the resault of the current research the UML Refactoring tool has been created. This tool provides analysis and transformation of the UML class diagrams.
  The user can import UML class diagrams in the XMI format, calculate metrics, transform diagram and export it back to the XMI.</p>

<p>The user can use Interface Insertion, Facade and Strategy transformations. The list of the transformations will be expanded later.</p>

<p>The list of the calculated metrics is the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Avg. CBO;</li>
  <li>Abg. DIT;</li>
  <li>Avg. NOC;</li>
  <li>Avg. NOM;</li>
  <li>Avg. NLM;</li>
  <li>Avg. DAC;</li>
  <li>SIZE2;</li>
  <li>DSC.</li>
</ul>
